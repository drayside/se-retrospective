Courses taken by SE Students
Patrick Lam, July 2020

I requested from OAT a list of courses taken by SE students between terms 1179 and 
1205. I manually excluded all courses in the faculties of Math and Engineering (no 
STV, yes COMM), and I manually combined enrollments between different terms.

    OAT query 1032, parameters: courses: .*, end_term: 1205, plan_group: uw.u.id.bac.se, start_term: 1179

# Breadth

I counted 65 distinct course prefixes and 176 distinct courses. The total number of 
enrollments was 1469 (out of 20515 enrollments in total; obviously SE students
mainly take courses from Math and Engineering).

We did have enrollments into all Faculties: Arts, Applied Health Sciences, 
Environment, and Science, as well as a small number of courses from St. Jerome's and 
a larger number of courses from Renison.

Arts        872
AHS           7
Environment  13
Science     461
Renison     113

# Observations about requisites

I noticed that different departments have different philosophies about requisites. 
English, for instance, has essentially no prerequisites. Economics has many courses 
with ECON 101/102 requisites. Political Science has a lot of courses which require 
PSCI 100/101/150.

There were no Arts courses taken by SE students which occured at the end of a 
requisite chain of length 3 (the most common way to satisfy the CS depth 
requirement). The longest chains were PHYS 334 (requires 234 which requires ECE 
105/106), and CHINA 302R (requires 301R, 202R, 201R, 120R; I did not observe 301R). 
The CS chain of length 3 requirement seems better suited to non-Arts courses in 
general.

# Upper level courses

The whole reason for this investigation was that I was talking with a current
SE student who wished that he had been forced to take more in-depth humanities
courses. I wondered how many non-intro Arts courses SE students took. The answer is:
almost none.

Let's define non-intro as a course that assumes some familiarity with the
field. That excludes courses like ECON 101, MUSIC 140, and PHIL 226. ENGL 306A
is "introduction to linguistics" and I'll exclude courses like that too.

ECON 212 is a non-intro Economics course (Game Theory) and was taken 13 times.
But it's pretty mathematical. ECON 206 (Money and Banking 1) is not quite so 
mathy and was taken 2 times.

Non-intro Political Science courses come up 7 times.

PSYCH 257 requires PSYCH 101 or 121 and was taken 4 times. (It is in the Cognitive 
Science Minor). Other Psychology courses show up an additional 3 times.

MUSIC 275 was taken twice and requires MUSIC 100/110.

The only other non-intro course I could see is LS 202, Criminal Law.

## Courses at level 300+

Another way of seeing how many non-intro courses SE students take is by
looking at courses numbered 300 and up.

ENGL:       3
HIST:       1
ARTS 490:   5
ECON:       1
PACS:       2
PHIL:       2
PSCI:       3
Total:     17

# Popularity contest

The most popular science courses were EARTH 122, SCI 238, and SCI 250, all with just 
over 100 enrollments each. The drop-off is steep after that: PHYS 234 has 27 and BIOL 
239 has 17.

The most popular language courses were JAPAN 101R (21) and CHINA 101R (14). Non-Renison
language courses were less popular, with 11 in SPAN 101 and 7 in GER 101. Les étudiants
en génie logiciel ont seulement pris 7 cours de français.

SPCOM 223 is the overwhelmingly most popular Arts course, with 230 enrollments.
It is also one of very few communications courses allowed in SE for students
in this period; the other common ones are ENGL 109, with 60 enrollments and SPCOM 100
with 50 enrollments.

Here are the top 8 Arts courses:

SPCOM 223  230
ECON 101    72
ENGL 109    60
MUSIC 140   53
SPCOM 100   50
CLAS 104    49
PHIL 226    35
PSYCH 101   26
